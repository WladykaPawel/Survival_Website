# survival_page

I created a website about my Hobby. This is a website whose code was written entirely by me. The programming language I wrote in was Vue.js

The Web page has a header that allows you to navigate through the website content:

The website also has a Music player on a separate subpage. (Only sample items are added)

The rest of the header redirects the user to the 3 subsections of survival: green, urban and military:

In the lower right part of the window there is a button that allows you to scroll to the top of the page:
